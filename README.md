Machine learning approach using a convolutional neural network classifier to relate Doppler spectra morphologies to the presence of (supercooled) liquid cloud droplets in mixed-phase clouds.

The release version provides the pre-trained machine learning model. Predictions are made by providing a list of Doppler radar time-spectrograms with dimensions: number of spectral bins = 256 and number of time steps = 6.

The model was trained on RPG-FMCW94 data collected during [DACAPO-PESO](https://dacapo.tropos.de/index.php/locations/15-dacapo-peso), therefore we recommend using this device for analysis. 

Two examples are provided.
